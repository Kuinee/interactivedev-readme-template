# Tourism Website

*One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.*

Our project is to create a tourism website featuring 3 countries, Singapore, Japan and Korea. You will be able to see the details about these 3 countries, such as their attractions, nearby hotels and will include some gifts that can be won through minigames featured on the website upon purchasing a hotel room from the website. You will also be able to log in to have a personal account which would be used to keep track of your stay and eligibility to play the minigames, it will also be the primary way to pay for the stay.

*Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.*
 
## Design Process
 
*Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.*
Our main target for this website is anyone who is interested in travelling to these countries or people who live in those countries and want to gain deeper insight into what their own country has to offer.

*In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
-As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.*

As a user looking to travel overseas to explore other countries, I would like to be able to view what the countries have to offer when I decide to visit them, so that I can have a better idea of what to expect and make a better judgement on what to do when visiting them.

As a user curious about my own country, I would like to be able to view what my own country has that would be interesting for a local like me, so that I can visit those places of interests or do those activities during my free time, so that I can better understand my own country and be able to find the hidden gems located in my country.

*This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.*

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
- The home page of our website displays a slideshow of the key attractions of the 3 countries our website will be featuring, with a short introduction about each country.
- There will be a page dedicated just for the attractions of the 3 countries, with this page showing off more attractions and information about them.
- There will be a FAQ page where the user may go to in order to find out the answers to their questions. If their question is not answered, there will be a form located at the bottom of the page for them to submit their question.
- There will be a page where they can purchase small popular souveniers such as bookmarks and keychains with designs from their respective countries.
- There will be a page featuring booking packages and deals the user can choose from, with various price ranges and hotel locations.
- At the checkout page, it will list the various details about the user's hotel choice and the total price. They will then be brought to a page asking them for details for payment. They will also be given a unique code which can be inputted into the souveniers page to access a game portion where they can win different prizes depending on the difficulty and how well they performed.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
